                                                       FoodPanda Analysis Dashboard

INTRODUCTION

This dashboard is designed to analyze Foodpanda’s business performance by combining sales, customer, payment, and delivery data into a single interactive view. The dashboard focuses on understanding how customers interact with the platform, how orders and revenue vary across cities, and how efficiently deliveries are completed. By visualizing these metrics, the dashboard helps stakeholders identify growth opportunities, operational challenges, and areas requiring strategic improvement.

KEY INSIGHTS

SALES AND ORDER PERFORMANCE

The sales and order analysis highlights the relationship between order volume and revenue generation across different cities and product categories. Some cities place a high number of order
but generate lower total sales, indicating smaller average order values. In contrast, certain cities generate higher revenue with fewer orders, suggesting premium pricing or higher-value
purchases. Category-level analysis helps identify which product types contribute the most to overall sales, enabling better inventory and marketing decisions.

CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR AND RETENTION

User-level analysis focuses on customer acquisition, engagement, and retention. The signup trend over time shows a consistent increase in new users, reflecting growing platform adoption.
Repeating customer analysis identifies users who place more than one order, providing insights into customer loyalty. Churn analysis by city highlights regions where customers stop ordering
after initial usage, allowing the business to design targeted retention strategies such as discounts, loyalty programs, or improved service quality.

PAYMENT METHOD ANALYSIS

The payment method analysis reveals clear regional differences in customer payment preferences. Map-based pie charts show how payment methods such as cash and card are distributed across
cities. Urban areas tend to favor digital payments, while some cities still rely heavily on cash on delivery. These insights help the company promote digital payment options, reduce cash 
handling risks, and design city-specific payment campaigns.

DELIVERY AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

Delivery performance is analyzed using delivery time metrics across cities. The box plot visualization highlights average delivery times, variability, and outliers. Cities with wide 
variations or extreme delays indicate potential logistical challenges such as traffic congestion or resource shortages. Identifying these operational inefficiencies enables the company to
optimize delivery routes, staffing, and partner performance.

BUSINESS VALUE

By integrating sales, customer behavior, payment trends, and delivery performance, the dashboard provides actionable insights that support strategic decision-making. It helps businesses 
improve customer retention, optimize operations, enhance user experience, and drive sustainable growth across different regions.

CONCLUSION

The Foodpanda Analytics Dashboard offers a comprehensive, data-driven view of the platform’s performance across multiple dimensions. It enables stakeholders to understand not just what is 
happening,but why it is happening, allowing for informed decisions that improve efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term profitability.
